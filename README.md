# MLAB hardware modules main repository
The MLAB Project was created to develop a universal kit to support hobbyist and professionals in the construction of simple or more complicated devices and instruments (robots, automation systems, testing kits and so on). It is primary intended for engineers and scientists and it is still in development since 2003.


**This repository is the only a component of [complete MLAB system](http://www.mlab.cz/)** 

## Modules

The principle of [Modular LABoratory](http://www.mlab.cz) is based on decomposition of complex systems to smaller cells or bricks (in MLAB called [modules](http://wiki.mlab.cz/doku.php?id=en:moduly)) such as communication interfaces, operational amplifiers, CPU modules, FPGA programmers and much more. Over years of development, tenths of modules have been created - for simplicity they are ordered in categories shown as folders in the repository.

When creating modules, the great emphasis is placed on the quality of design and construction. The results can, therefore, meet the standards of even the most demanding users from the community of researchers, experimenters and innovators.

## How to start using MLAB

Further information could be found on [MLAB Wiki](http://wiki.mlab.cz/).

There is also a [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mlab-users) and available for users and developers.

## Compatibility

Thanks to the careful design, most of the modules are dimensionally and electrically compatible with many other products. The examples include Arduino platform, Merkur construction set, optical tables or DIN switchboard systems.


## Applications

The possible applications are quite wide, see the [list of Designs](http://www.mlab.cz/Server/GenIndex/GenIndex.php?path=%2FDesigns&lang=en)
